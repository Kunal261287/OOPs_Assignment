    "1. Class Variable\n",
    "A class variable is a variable that is shared among all instances of a class. It is defined inside the class but outside any method, and it is accessed using the class name or via instances.\n",

    "Class variables are common to all instances of the class, meaning that if one instance modifies the class variable, it will reflect in all other instances (unless overridden by an instance variable).\n",
